            <p>I'm not strictly agaisnt website builders and templates, I think they are a great option for people who don't nessessarily have the resources or skills to build their own website.
                Although I do belive there are far better options that get good enough results such as learning HTML and CSS like I did.
                When looking to create a website it seemed idiotic to not use a site builder until i tried to use one.
                Almost all of them require you to create an account, share email addresses, use obsene amounts of javascript, and flood your inbox with promotional emails.
                After realizing this flaw in nearly every single one I looked at (except HUGO which is a strong outlier and seems the best out of all of them) it seemed clear to not use a builder.

            <p>The next best option from a website builder seemed to be a template that i could easily modify to fit my needs.
                After searching for hours for a template that was at least somewhat decent for my wants I gave up and decided to see what could be done on my own.
                I feel lucky to have a dad and my s/o able to help me learn HTML and CSS.
                If you are interested in learning either one of these languages I highly reccomend <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools.</a>
                I was able to pickup basic HTML fairly quick but CSS is kinda awful and took a fair bit to get down and even now its annoying to use although thats only when moving things around.

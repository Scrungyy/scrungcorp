            <p>This project was quite fun to do as it wasn't something I had done before. 
                The project consists of 4 main parts, Creating a style guide, creating at least 3 variations of that logo, creating a slogan and finally a billboard sign of that logo.
                This is where the name "Scrungcorp" came to be.
            </p>
            <p>These are my 5 variations of my logo.</p>
            <img style="width: 512px" src="../../../images/gd/company-logo/3variation.png" alt="">
            <p> This is the final variation from the variations sheet and the base for future projects</p>

            <p>The slogan "The Right Man in the Wrong Place" was inspired by a GMan quote from Half-Life 2</p>
